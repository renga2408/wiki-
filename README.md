# wiki-chatbot using cnns
**Overview**

This project aims to develop a chatbot using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to interact with users and provide information sourced from a Wiki-like knowledge base.

**Features**

Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot utilizes NLP techniques to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are used to process and extract meaningful features from text data, enhancing the chatbot's understanding and response capabilities.

Wiki Knowledge Base: The chatbot's responses are sourced from a Wiki-like knowledge base, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface, making it easy to ask questions and receive answers.

**Installation**

_Clone the repository:_

git clone _**https://github.com/renga2408/WIKI-CHATBOT-USING-CNNs**_

_Install dependencies:_

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download and preprocess the Wiki knowledge base data.

Train the CNN model using the preprocessed data.

_Run the chatbot application:_

python chatbot.py

**Usage**

To start a conversation with the chatbot, simply type your query into the chat interface and press Enter.

The chatbot will process your query using the CNN model and provide a response based on the information available in the Wiki knowledge base.
